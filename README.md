# continuous-user-auth-verification

About the System

Provide secure user authentication for web application.
     - traditionally based on pairs of username and password 
     - biometric techniques offer emerging solution 
A single authentication point and a single biometric data are not always sufficient to guarantee authenticity.
     - trend towards multi-modal biometric and continuous authentication protocols 
The proposed approach for user verification is Continuous Authentication system. 
    - adaptive session timeouts 
    - credentials acquired transparently

Advantages:

Our approach does not require that the reaction to a user verification mismatch is executed by the user device (e.g., the logout procedure), 
but it is transparently handled by the Continuous authentication service and the web services, which apply their own reaction procedures.

It provides a tradeoff between usability and security.
